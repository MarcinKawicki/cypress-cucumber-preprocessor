# Messages reports

"Messages" refers to [Cucumber Messages](https://github.com/cucumber/common/tree/main/messages) and is a low-level report / protocol for representing results and other information from Cucumber. JSON reports and HTML reports are derived from this report. Hence, messages report will implicitly be enabled if either of the mentioned reports are.

Messages reports can be enabled using the `messages.enabled` property. The preprocessor uses [cosmiconfig](https://github.com/davidtheclark/cosmiconfig), which means you can place configuration options in EG. `.cypress-cucumber-preprocessorrc.json` or `package.json`. An example configuration is shown below.

```json
{
  "messages": {
    "enabled": true
  }
}
```

The report is outputted to `cucumber-messages.ndjson` in the project directory, but can be configured through the `messages.output` property.
